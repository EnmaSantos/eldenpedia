# EldenPedia Development Roadmap (Phase 2)

This document outlines the next steps to transform EldenPedia from a V1 Prototype into a full-featured companion app.

## 1. Profile & Settings Management
**Goal:** Allow users to customize their Tarnished profile beyond just a username.
*   **[x] Create `/settings` Page:**
    *   Input fields for `username`, `bio` (or "Covenant").
    *   **Avatar Upload:** Allow users to upload a custom image to Supabase Storage instead of the generated pixel art.
    *   **Default Stats:** Allow users to set "Default Stats" (e.g., Level 150 meta) so they don't have to re-type 60 Vigor every time.
*   **[x] Database Update:**
    *   Add `bio`, `favorite_weapon_id`, `playstyle` columns to the `profiles` table.

## 2. Build Management Enhancements
**Goal:** Make the `/builds` page a true "Workshop", not just an archive.
*   **[x] Create Build from Scratch:**
    *   Add a "New Build" button on `/builds`.
    *   Opens a dedicated Build Editor (similar to Weapon Comparison but focused on one setup: Armor + Talismans + Weapons).
*   **[x] Edit Existing Builds:**
    *   Add an "Edit" button to load a saved build back into the editor.
*   **[x] Armor & Talismans:**
    *   Currently, we only track Weapons. We need to fetch Armor and Talismans from the API (`/api/armors`, `/api/talismans`) to make a complete build calculator.

## 3. Full API Integration (The "Wiki" Aspect)
**Goal:** Use all available data endpoints to become a true encyclopedia.
*   **[x] Items & Consumables:**
    *   Create `/items` page.
    *   Fetch from `/api/items`.
    *   Added "Mechanics Guides" for Crafting, Spirits, and Smithing.
*   **[ ] Spells & Incantations:**
    *   Create `/magic` page.
    *   Fetch from `/api/sorceries` and `/api/incantations`.
    *   Add "Spell Scaling" to the AR Calculator (requires new math logic).
*   **[ ] Bosses & Enemies:**
    *   Enhance the Guide to link to real Boss Data (Weaknesses, Drops) instead of just names.
    *   Fetch from `/api/bosses`.

## 4. Community Features (Future)
*   **[ ] Public Build Gallery:**
    *   A page to see "Trending Builds" from other users (query `is_public = true` from Supabase).
*   **[ ] Comments/Ratings:**
    *   Allow users to "Upvote" a build.

## 5. Technical Debt & Polish
*   **[ ] Mobile Optimization:** Ensure complex tables (AR Calculator) look good on phones.
*   **[ ] Image Hosting:** Currently using API URLs. If the API goes down, images break. Consider caching images.
*   **[x] SEO:** Add metadata for every weapon page (`/weapons/[id]`) so Google indexes "Moonveil Stats EldenPedia". (Dynamic route created)
